# Mocha Test Driven Development

        Mocha is a framework used to run tests on single units of code written using Node.js.
        The framework uses a describe() function
        This function takes a string and a fat arrow function
        The string is used as a name to describe your test suite
        The fat arrow ( ()=> {} ) function basically encapsulates all of your tests
        for this particular test suite. Within this function you write a series
        of "it" functions which represent your tests.
